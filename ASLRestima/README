Description:
ASLRestima is a tool to evaluate the entropy of a system's ASLR. When run, it outputs 3 plots per memory segment: 
(1) a scatter plot illustrating the segment's starting memory addresses, (
2) a scatter plot illustrating a flattened view of plot 1, for clearer identification of gaps, and 
(3) a histogram illustrating the distribution of the points in bins. 

It also provides statistics (via chi-squared) on the likelihood that the data came from a random distribution and select measures of offset entropy between segments.


How To Run:
The main files for ASLRestima are:
1. ASLRestima.sh -> master shell script that contains calls to all functionality
2. ASLRestima.config -> configuration file that allows users to dictate run settings
3. ASLRestimaFunctions.sh -> shell script with supporting functions, directly used by ASLRestima.sh

To run, edit the config file as needed. Then execute ./ASLRestima.sh.


Running segments separately:
heap_entropy.c, libso_entropy.c, mmap_entropy.c, stack_entropy.c, text_entropy.c, vdso_entropy.c
These can be run independently by including the .config as a source file, and then executing "loop_mem_segment [memsegment]".

entropy64.c
This function requires a txt file with address information in binary (generated by running loop_mem_segment, as described above).
./entropy64 addressesInBinary.text
